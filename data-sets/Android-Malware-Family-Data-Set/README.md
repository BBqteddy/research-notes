# Android Malware Family Data Set

This data set is derived from a series of mixed Android APK files gathered by [WildFire(TM)](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/secure-the-network/wildfire) malware analysis service at Palo Alto Networks. There are two groups included in the data set, benign (90,877 samples) and malware (104,748 samples). For each malware sample, we provide a malware family id and family name. Samples with the same family id belong to the same malware family.

No sample file is included in this data set. Instead, for each sample, we provide the static and dynamic analysis report (XML format). Static analysis report contains details extracted from the APK file. The dynamic analysis report contains observed behaviors and logs when evaluating the sample in the customized sandbox environment in WildFire. To locate a report, each sample is identified by its SHA256 value. 

Specifically, the data set is organized as follows:

* benign : a set of benign sample analysis reports;
* benign_samples.json : a profile file contains the SHA256, file paths to the static and dynamic analysis reports.
* malware : a set of malware sample analysis reports;
* malware_samples.json : a profile file contains the SHA256, malware family id & name, file paths to the static and dynamic analysis reports.

To use the data set in machine learning applications, one may extract features from the included analysis report files. Sample files are not included due to the sample file size. One may download the sample files from other sources with the included SHA256 values.
