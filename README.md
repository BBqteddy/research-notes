Palo Alto Networks has world-renowned experts supporting threat research efforts across the company. The completely in-house team focuses on quickly identifying, analyzing, and creating protections for attacks as they emerge—building and enhancing the automated prevention enforced through our Security Operating Platform.

The team is comprised of:
* Threat engineers, conducting research into all facets of the threat landscape and building our cloud delivered security services.

* Vulnerability research, identifying new threats (including proactive research into critical zero-day vulnerabilities), and building signatures to prevent exploitation.

* Global Security Response team, assessing new threats and ensuring the efficacy of our protections across the platform.

* Unit 42 team, researching the latest cyber attacks and sharing the results freely with the entire community.

* Endpoint and behavioral analytics threat researchers
